**📊 End-to-End Data Analytics Project
🔍 Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior data to identify purchasing patterns, trends, and insights that can help businesses make data-driven decisions.  
The analysis is performed using Python for data processing, MySQL for data storage, and Power BI for interactive visualization.

This project is inspired by a YouTube tutorial and extended for hands-on learning and portfolio demonstration.
